# About me
<img src="Bank.jpg" width="150"/>

Hello! I am Bank (he/him). I am a second year MBA student at Tepper Business School at Carnegie Mellon University. I am originally from Bangkok, Thailand where you can find delish foods in every corner of the street! I'm interested in analyzing financial performance of the business and presenting an awesome visualization to stakeholders (i.e. investors, buyers, or regulators). I practiced my data visualization skill when I worked as an M&A consultant at PwC. It involved the process of simplifying the complex financial transactions and making stories with charts to support our presentation to our buy-side client. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to visualize more complex data besides the financial numbers to many types of readers. It is because after my graduation, I have to work on the mid-management position which I would be expected to be able to not only "report what's going on in my business" but also "convince the stakeholders in different situations by selling the stories". That's why I take this course where I can do trail and errors without any business damages.

Here's where all my cool data visualization will go! I hope you enjoy it!
