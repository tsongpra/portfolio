# Chart1: Government Debt-to-GDP by country over 1995-2019
This graph shows the movement of government debt-to-GDP over 1995-2019 country by country. It is good for someone who wants to focus on a specific country over the period. However, it is difficult to integrate and see the big picture of government debt around the world.

# Chart2: Top 10 Government Debt-to-GDP by country over 1995-2019
This graph was created to show the comparison of the government debt-to-GDP scale by country around the world. This animated bar chart is usable for those who want to see the movement of a specific country and those who want to see the overall big picture.
I also highlighted the 3 countries including Japan, Greece, and the U.S. because I assume that largest of the population (and viewers who visit my page) are from the U.S., while Greece is the country that has such a high government debt amount that the country once was bankruptcy. Lastly, it was so surprising that Japan was the top country that has the largest government debt-to-GDP ratio in the world. These are the story that I wanted to highlight on my presentation. Another miscelleneous information could be seen in the bar chart.
