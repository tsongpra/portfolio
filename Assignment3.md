I selected this article because studying an MBA is a huge investment of life. One of the critical factors when choosing MBA schools is the return after graduation, which means how your MBA program increase your pre-MBA salary. Therefore, this data visualization is useful to all prospective MBA students when choosing MBA schools.

# Why this visualization is problematic ?
I rely on the critique method named the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. Here is my analysis
1) Usefuleness - The target audience for this article could be prospective MBA students and general people who are interested in MBA world. This one shows the useful information to the targets because they expect to see how financially worth the MBA schools are. So, this is useful.
2) Completeness - All information is clearly. To compare the salary increase by school, it needs pre-MBA salary, post-MBA salary, and the name of schools.
3) Perceptibility - This dimension is problematic since readers use a huge effort to understand. It is because this involves many of schools (40-50 schools) across the world. The color to categorize the region is not clear since you can see that Europe, Canada, and United States are a shade of blue. It takes a few minutes to realize that a dot with a school name label is empty, while other dots without the label is not empty.
4) Truthfulness - The comparison could be improved since the y-axis is the raw numbers. This is misleading because some schools already have a high average pre-MBA salary. However, those schools could not improve the salary much even though the post-MBA is still high. 
5) Intuitiveness - This is not difficult that much to digest the information on the visualization. However, it contains too much number of schools. 
6) Aestetics - It looks professional and appropriate to MBA world and the website brand (Economists). However, the blue shades are unclear and the bars are close to each other too much. Therefore, the presentation should be more simple.
7) Engagement - It inspires to the audience to continue reading the articles because the article could be written some interesting trends and why the top schools can help their student improve their salary.
