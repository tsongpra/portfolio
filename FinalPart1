Page 3: This is the reasons

3.1 Teacher - Schools in Thailand requires theie teacher applicants to have a bachelor degree in Education (major in the subject they teach such as Maths, Physics etc.)
We are facing a shortage of teacher supplies (a ratio between teacher and student is 1:21 compared to 1:10 in Finland where is the best education in the world. 
A key reason pf lacking teacher is because the remuneration is not appealing. You can see that the average starting salary of Thailand teacher is higher than the minimum wage 50% (teacher = 180k/ minimum wage = 120k).


3.2 Education objective - Thailand students study for Exam, but not for learning. The percentage of getting accepted from all tiers university is around 60% and the number of student enrollment for thier bachelor degree drops to XX%.  
This is not surprising that most high-school students have to study at prep schools for enhancing a chance of get accepted. This pressure generates the prosperity of the prep school business and generated the market share around XXX million USD in Thailand. 
Not to mention, Even though you may know that Korea is well known for a hard studying, Thailand becomes the country that their students spend the extra time after class more than Korea students do.


3.3 Centralized educational system - All top tier schools and top prep schools are located in Bangkok province, a capital of Thailand. We can see that the top 20 schools ranking by the national test score are located in Bangkok.
Morevoer, the national test score from school in Bangkok is higher than other schools. Therefore, pupils in the marginalized area were disadvantaged to get a higher degree by default.
