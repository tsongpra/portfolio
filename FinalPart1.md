*Time to CHANGE: A failure in Thailand's Education*
Thailand's high school students struggled with the unstructured and poor quality of the university admission

What I want to achieve is to call out the awareness and movement to change the current Thailand Educational Sysytem.

My target group is to the current high school Thai students who are suffering from the system, their parents who have no idea what their children are facing but may blaim them when the result is unpleasant, and general Thai people who wants to see the better future of Thailand because this current students would become the next generation of Thailand leaders.


*Outline*

I will break into 3 parts.

Part 1: Problem identification - shows how Thailand (poor) perform compared to other countries in terms of education quality to provoke the reader's thought that "Thailand education is problematic" and "Why?"
I will display the PISA score of Thailand compared to an average PISA score, English literacy, and the reverse relationship between the long class hour and the student's performance.
The funny thing is the biggest portion of government spending goes with the educational department. However, the global presence of Thailand is bad.
These 3 support the consequence of poor quality Thailand's educational system.

Part 2: Why? This is the reasons...

3.1 Teacher - Schools in Thailand requires theie teacher applicants to have a bachelor degree in Education (major in the subject they teach such as Maths, Physics etc.)
We are facing a shortage of teacher supplies (a ratio between teacher and student is 1:21 compared to 1:10 in Finland where is the best education in the world.), while the clas size is around 40 students per class.
A key reason of lacking teacher is because the remuneration is not appealing. You can see that the average starting salary of Thailand teacher is higher than the minimum wage 50% (teacher = 180k/ minimum wage = 120k).

The charts that I will create.

(1) Ratio between students and teacher: 21 people figure coloring blue representing students and 1 people figure for teacher.

(2) Class size: 40 people figure coloring blue again but will have a square surrounded to represent a classroom (if possible)

(3) A big number of teacher annual salary compared with minimum wage and other careers (engineers, accountants etc.) to show that "teacher" is not a pleasant or well-paid job.

3.2 Education objective - Thailand students study for Exam, but not for learning. The percentage of getting accepted from all tiers university is around 60% and the number of student enrollment for thier bachelor degree drops to XX%.  
This is not surprising that most high-school students have to study at prep schools for enhancing a chance of get accepted. This pressure generates the prosperity of the prep school business and generated the market share around XXX million USD in Thailand. 
Not to mention, Even though you may know that Korea is well known for a hard studying, Thailand becomes the country that their students spend the extra time after class more than Korea students do.

The charts that I will create.

(1) Line chart of enrollment status 4-5 past years from middle schools to high schools and compare with the accepted rate each year. 

(2) The bar chart to represent the growing market size in the 5 past years with the label for top 5 of market share. This graph will show that most students study for passing their national exam and get accepted from the college that they wanted.

(3) The thermometer chart to show the 3 countries comparison.


3.3 Centralized educational system - All top tier schools and top prep schools are located in Bangkok province, a capital of Thailand. We can see that the top 20 schools ranking by the national test score are located in Bangkok.
Morevoer, the national test score from school in Bangkok is higher than other schools. Therefore, pupils in the marginalized area were disadvantaged to get a higher degree by default.

(1) Geography map to show that the top school is concentrated in the capital.

(2) A bar chart to compare between the average national test score amoung the region (Bangkok, Central, North, West, East, South) and area (urban, suburban) to highlight that the education is concentrated at capital.

Part 3: Summary
I will provide an example of Finland - the best education country in the world to see what did they differently from Thailand. And I will end up with the emotional quote to call for the awareness to *CHANGE*
